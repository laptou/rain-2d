This is vector graphics software that I worked on from 2017 to 2018. It represents my first major attempt
to develop this kind of app, and while I did learn a lot from programming this, I have had to abandon the
project.

What's in here right now is not a complete application, but it _does_ work 
(you can open SVG files and mess around with them).
